# reactPhpBlogTemplate2
[reactPhpBlogTemplate](https://github.com/emily-daitch/reactPhpBlogTemplate/blob/live/README.md) without create-react-app

# Getting Started
To get started, please clone the main branch of this repository and download XAMPP if you wish to develop changes locally with Apache and MySQL.
Alternatively, you can set the environment variable LOCAL_DEV to false and use a hosting platform of your choice, I have chosen Hostinger.
You can see my implementation [here](https://emilydaitch.click) and I recommend setting up a staging subdomain for testing changes before you deploy them, especially if you are not using XAMPP to develop locally.
